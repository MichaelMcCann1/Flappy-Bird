# Flappy-Bird

A Flappy Bird clone I made using vanilla JavaScript. Start the game by either clicking the mouse or by pressing the spacebar. On mobile you start the game by tapping anywhere on the screen. Avoid hitting the ground or the pipes by jumping. To jump you can either click the mouse, press the spacebar, or on mobile tap the screen. You earn one point for every set of pipes you pass through.
